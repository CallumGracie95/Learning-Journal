Content Insights
----------------
I felt quite confident using HTML, JS and tailwind to make my site. However, I struggled to deploy it to github pages. This was because my tailwind css config was incorrect. I had it working fine on the live server but had to spend many hours troubleshooting to get it working on github pages.
