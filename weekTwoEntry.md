Content Insights
----------------
In the CCP a template with a location of site implies it is for the front end. A location tagged 'Administrator' refers to the backend. 
I learned that categories are like folders that primarily exist in the back end of my Joomla site. They provide an organsied space for articles.
I learned that we use the menu manager to create content to navigate between. Essentially we have a menu > category > article. I also learned 
to use the template option button to make on the fly amendments to my pages. 

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
--------------------------------------

I found no additional insights in regards to employability or career. By the end of this semester I aim to have a good base understand how to use CMS
so I may expand on my knowledge in the workplace and my own time when required.
